# This is my hobby "Smart Home" project. 

## How it works

Many different kinds of [IOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things)s connected to [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/) broker. For example [IOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) may listen for topic "home/basement/light1", if it gets message "on" - device turning on the light in basement. Another device can publish temperature every few minutes. e.t.c.

WebServer also connected to [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/) broker. It listening to the triggers and sends commands. The WebApp contains management of all equipment and rules. It contains database to store historical data like events, temperature, humidity e.t.c. The WebApp also gives interface to monitor & manually controll every connected device.

Server have [REST API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) to send/recieve commands of outer services with limited/secured connection by port forwarding to the internet - so services like [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/discover) may be configured with any other smart home services like Alexa or Google assist or any other 3rd party service.

Each IOT device may be configured by IOT configurator (Also esp8266 device). When you installing or moving one of IOT devices across your house, you just need to start it in "install" mode when [IOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) configurator is on. Devices will automatically connect and configuration will be copied from configurator into IOT device flash memory. 

Configuration contains:
* WiFi SSID / WiFi Password 
* MQTT IP
* Device Name (to recognize it in management)
* Location ( for example: home/2ndfloor/kids-room ) - Location will be used as MQTT topic prefix


## System components
1. Management Web Application
2. IOT devices
3. MQTT broker 
4. NodeMcu IOT Configurator

### 1. Management Web Application

Manage and monitor your house from web.

### 2. IOT devices

Any type of IOT devices which may subscribe for MQTT topics or trigger/push messages to MQTT broker.

### 3. MQTT broker 

Lightweight MQTT service. Running on raspberry PI.

### 4. NodeMcu IOT Configurator

This is autonomus device to configure other IOT devices. It includes small oled display where user can see configuration. When it is on any IOT may connect to it and get this configuration.
